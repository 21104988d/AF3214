Market Structure Analytics
• One of accounting and
finance analytics is market
structure analytics.
• The US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC)
created this website to
promote better
understanding of their equity
markets and equity market
structure through the use of
data and analytics:

Algorithmic Trading

 Algorithmic trading is an automated trading approach that uses computer algorithms to trade
the markets.
 These algorithms create buy and sell orders and automatically send the orders to the market
via the brokerage platform.

 For a trading algorithm to place an order, the market conditions must match the
predefined criteria.
Examples of Simple Trading Algorithms:

 Short 20 lots of GBP/USD if rises above 1.3610. For every 5 pip rise in GBP/USD, cover
the short by 2 lots. For every 5 pip fall in GBP/USD, increase the short position by 1 lot.
 Buy 100,000 shares of Tencent (0700.HK) if the price falls below 400. For every 0.1%
increase in price beyond 400, buy 1000 shares. For every 0.1% decrease in price below
400, sell 1000 shares.

Overview of the Asset Types
• Stocks – (also knowns as shares or equity) is a type of security that signifies proportionate ownership
in the issuing corporation.
• It entitles the holders to that proportion of the corporation’s assets and earnings.

Overview of the Asset Types – Cont’d

• Options – An agreement
between a buyer and
seller that gives the
purchaser of the option
the right to buy or sell a
particular asset at a later
date at an agreed price.
• Most often used in
securities, commodities,
and real estate transaction

7

Overview of the Asset Types – Cont’d

• FOREX – Known as foreign
exchange or currency trading
is a decentralized global
market where all the world’s
currencies trade.
• It is the most liquid market in
the world with an average
daily trading volume
exceeding $5 trillion.
• Active 24/7 due to different
time zones.

8

Overview of the Asset Types – Cont’d
• Cryptocurrencies – A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as
a medium of exchange.
• Become increasingly popular.
• They are different from currencies because they are decentralized assets
currently not regulated or controlled by any one country, central bank, or
regulatory authority. Except for El Salvador.

The Market Players

• Exchanges – An exchange is an institution, organization, or association
which hosts a market where stocks, bonds, options, futures, and
commodities are traded.
• They are places dedicated to trading.
• They impose rules and regulations on the firms and brokers involved in them.

The Market Players – Cont’d
• Broker or Dealer – is a person
or firm in the business of
buying and selling securities
for its own account or on
behalf of is customers.
• A brokerage acts as a broker
when it execute orders on
behalf of its clients.
• A dealer or principal – Trades
for its own account.

11

The Market Players – Cont’d

“Sell-Side” – brokers and dealers that
facilitate the issuance and selling of
assets

“Buy-side” – Institutional/individual
investors that purchase stocks,
securities, and other financial products
for their company or clients.

Brief History of Electronic Trading
• In the 1960s, computer networks were
used to route prices to computer
terminals.
• Most orders were still carried out over
the phone or in person on exchanges.
• By the mid 1990s, many of the world’s
major stock exchanges were trading a
considerable proportion of their volume
electronically.
• The bond market has been slower to
adopt electronic trading, due to them
being centered more on market makers
rather than exchanges.
• Overall, electronic trading has made the
world markets accessible to a much
wider range of users. Without this
innovation, algorithmic trading, DMA,
and automated crossing would not exist.

DMA : an introduction to direct access trading
strategies.
13

The Trading Process
trade flow from the point of view of an investor
1.Buy-side initiated trade is placed
as an order with a broker.
2.The broker will communicate the
order to a trader/dealer.
3.The trader would then either
quote a price to trade against their
own inventory or alternatively
work the order on an exchange.

• Nowadays, electronic trading has predominantly taken over this whole
process.
• Wall Street Traders Were VERY Intense in 1980:

15

The Trading Process – Cont’d

• Direct Market Access (DMA) is
where brokers allow clients access
to their order routing
infrastructure.
• This allows the buy-side to issue
their electronic orders almost
directly to the exchanges,
effectively giving them much the
same level of control over an
order's execution as a sell-side
trader has.

15

The Trading Process – Cont’d

• Sponsored Access takes this to
the next level, for clients whose
high-frequency trading
strategies need ultra-low
latency connections.
• Essentially, this allows clients to
connect directly to the market

15

Algorithmic Trading
• A computerized system is
responsible for executing the
order to buy or sell a given
asset, rather than being
worked manually by a trader.
• A computer program follows
preset to determine how each
order should be executed.
• Both Algorithmic Trading and
DMA allow clients access to
trade on markets known as
Direct Access Trading.

18

Institutional Trading Types
• Portfolio Trading – Referred
to as basket or program trading.
Provides investors with cost
effective means of trading
multiple assets, rather than
having to trade them
individually.
• An ETF is an example of a
basket of securities that trade
on an exchange just like a stock.
• ETF are a collection of stocks
or securities that track an
underlying index.

19

Institutional Trading Types – Cont’d

• Systematic Trading –
Adopting the same approach for
trading. Such as dictating points
for trade entry and exit.
• An example would be comparing
market prices with boundary
conditions.
• Can require an intricate set of
rules, which accommodate a
wide range of intraday conditions
such as price, volume, or
volatility.

20

Forms of Systematic Trading

• Quantitative Trading – Sometimes referred to as
“Blackbox” trading.
• Trading rules are enforced by adopting proprietary
quantitative models.
• Strategies can range from tracking indicators to
determine trade initiation and close out, to
monitoring the overall portfolio risk.

21

Forms of Systematic Trading – Cont’d
• High frequency trading – Aims to take advantage of
opportunities intraday.
• The time scales involved range from hours down to seconds or
even fractions of a second.
• A specialized form of Blackbox/quantitative trading focused on
exploiting short-term gains.
• High frequency traders adopt a similar style to market maker,
where they keep a neutral position except to take advantage of
any price discrepancies.

22

Forms of Systematic Trading – Cont’d
• Statistical arbitrage – represents a systematic investment/trading
approach, which is based on a combination of real time and
historical data analysis.
• The main difference from high frequency trading is that strategies
may span over longer timeframes.
• The goals are similar, both try to take advantage of mispricing whilst
minimizing the overall exposure to risk.
• Strategies try to find trends or indicators from previous data and
then use these to gain an edge.
• Time series analysis, data mining, and artificial intelligence are
employed to isolate useful information from the mass of data that
available.
23

ALGORITHMIC
TRADING

Deep Dive into Algorithmic Trading

• An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a given task,
therefore a trading algorithm is just a computerized model that
incorporates the steps required to trade an order in a specific way.
• Due to the nature of trading algorithms and their need to constantly
react to ever changing market conditions these rules can become
quite complex.
25

Deep Dive into Algorithmic Trading

• An example of a simple trading algorithm is a slicing strategy, where
a big order is broken up and a certain amount is traded during certain
periods to achieve a certain average price.
• Modern trading algorithms have evolved from this simplistic order
slicing strategy to the point where their trading patterns are
unrecognizable.
• They are designed to target the best execution, given the specified
objectives.

26

Evolution of Trading algorithms

• Early on trading algorithms were natural evolutions of simple order
slicing.
• Their main focus was on meeting specific benchmarks, starting with a
Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and progressing on to Volume
Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
• Both the early on TWAP and VWAP algorithms were statically driving.
Therefore once an order was received, a specific trading schedule was
determined, which then drive the trading algorithm.
• Using these statically created schedules proved vulnerable, because
market participants could easily spot and take advantage of a regular
trading pattern.

27

Evolution of Trading Algorithms – Cont’d
• The second generation of trading algorithms were created in
response to the application of transaction cost analysis.
• Transaction cost analysis breaks down all the various costs associated
with trading.
• It highlighted that the effect an order has on the asset’s price was not
the only significant cost.
• Other factors, such as timing risk and opportunity costs, could
actually outweigh the market impact.
• The first generation of algorithms were not designed to be price or
risk sensitive; they were just simply focused on reducing overall
market impact.

28

Evolution of Trading Algorithms – Cont’d
• The third generation of
algorithms have resulted from the
ongoing search for liquidity
triggered by rapid proliferation of
electronic crossing networks
and alternative trading
systems.
• Electronic crossing network is an
alternative trading system that
matches buy and sell orders
electronically for execution
without first routing the order to
an exchange or other displayed
market.

29

Evolution of Trading Algorithms – Cont’d

• The combination of multiple venues and increasing
transparency has helped transform simple order routing
systems into complex liquidity-based algorithms.
• They constantly examine the order books of different venues
to decide where it is best to place orders.
• Off-market trading has also shifted to new electronic venues in
particular the “dark pools” (private exchanges) or alternative
trading system (ATS).

30

DIRECT ACCESS
TRADING

Direct Access Trading

• Represents the shift in access and control of execution to
the buy-side.
• Investors and buy-side traders can now get direct access
allowing them to place orders on many of the worlds’
financial marketplaces.
• Direct access trading was synonymous with DMA, but
with crossing and algorithmic trading, institutions now
have a broader choice of execution methods.

32

Direct Access Trading – Cont’d
• Direct Market Access extends the principle of remote access
to a broker’s clients.
• It has been present since the 1980s.
• With DMA, the client can take advantage of the broker’s
infrastructure to send their orders to the exchange.
• A key concern is leaking of information; therefore DMA
services are run by brokers as a separate entity to protect
client orders.

33

Sponsored Access
• Sponsored access caters for buy-side clients with highfrequency trading strategies.
• Markets usually require the broker to monitor the trading,
ensuring that no excessive risks are taken.
• Monitoring can be carried out pre-trade, either with a fast,
dedicated system, or by using a solution. This adds some
overhead.
• Naked Access is when monitoring is done post trade. This
does not allow the broker to prevent erroneous trading.

34

Crossing

• Institutions often need to trade in large sizes, but large block
orders can expose them to price risk
• In the past, the large orders would have been handled by
brokers off the trading floor.
• “Upstairs Market”, since these negotiations took place
upstairs in broker’s offices, away from the exchange floor.
• Crossing systems provide an electronic mechanism allowing
investors to carry out their own block trading anonymously.

35

Crossing – Cont’d
• These system aggregate orders and then match them at set
points throughout the day.
• These anonymous trading venues ensure that order details
are hidden, hence they have often been referred to as “dark
pools” of liquidity.
• They offer the buy-side the chance to cut out the broker as
an intermediary and trade anonymously with each other.
• Orders using crossing systems or Alternative Trading System
(ATS) are not guaranteed to execute; the focus is on
achieving a better price and minimizing information leakage.
36

Direct Liquidity Access

• Managing an order on a crossing network or ATS is
essentially the same as DMA, therefore vendors now offer
solutions that enable access to both mechanisms.
• Direct Liquidity Access does not only just combine DMA
and crossing, but also includes features such as liquidity
aggregation, where smart order routing or custom trading
algorithms are used to seek out sufficient liquidity at the
desired price.

37

Manual Trading

• There are still perks to manual
trading.
• It allows the client to discuss
the order with the broker.
• It gives them an opportunity to
gain new market information
and analysis.

38

MARKET
MICROSTRUCTURE

What is it?

• Market microstructure is a branch of finance
concerned with details of how exchange occurs in
the markets.
• It focuses on the key mechanisms involved in trading
and helps explain many of the costs.

41

The Fundamentals

• The purpose of a market is to bring buyers and sellers
together.
• Capital markets may be categorized into primary and
secondary markets.
• Primary market deals with issuance of new assets/securities.
• The secondary market is the subsequent trading of these
assets.

42

Primary Market

• Government bonds issued
via specialized auctions
• Initial Public Offerings
(IPOs), follow-up offerings,
and so on.
• Corporate Debt (Bonds) is
generally placed using
underwriters.

43

Secondary Market

• Secondary markets are
important because investors will
be more willing to provide capital
if they know the assets may
readily be traded.
• The flexibility allows them to
withdraw capital when needed
and to switch between assets.
• Therefore the one of the main
focuses of market microstructure
is the efficiency of the secondary
markets.
44

Liquidity
• Liquidity is a vital aspect of trading.
• A liquid market or asset should
have lower cost for immediacy, i.e.
trading costs.
• More liquid markets or assets will
also usually have higher trading
volumes.
• The stock market is generally more
liquid than the real estate market.
• Characteristics of market liquidity
can be characterized in terms of
three main features
• Depth
• Tightness
• Resilience
45

Liquidity – Cont’d
• Depth – indicates the total
quantity of buy and sell orders
that are available for the asset
around the equilibrium price. Thus
a deep market enables us to trade
large volumes without causing
sizable price movements.
• Tightness – bid offer spread. The
difference between the prices to
buy and sell an asset.
• Resilience – How quickly the
market recovers from a shock. A
resilient market will suffer less
price discrepancies from trading.
So changes in price do not affect
the overall level of trading or
availability of orders.

Types of Markets

• Two most important properties for classifying
markets are the following.
• Trading Mechanism
• Trading Frequency

49

Trading Mechanism

• Markets are generally thought of as being either quote
driven, order-driven, or a mix.
• A purely quote-driven market means traders must
transact with a dealer/market maker who quotes prices
at which they will buy and sell a given quantity.
• Order driven markets allow all traders to participate
equally, which means placing orders on an order book
that are then matched using a set of rules.

50

Examples of Quote Driven Market

Bonds
Currencies
Commodities
51

Order Driven Market
• Prices are established by an
actual order.
• The best bid price represents the
highest priced buy order.
• The best offer is set by the lowest
priced sell order.
• A trade may only occur when a
buy order matches the current
best offer price.
• Key difference is that instead of
reacting to the market maker’s
two-way quote, we react to the
available liquidity on the order
book.

52

Benefits of Order Driven Markets

• Persistence of orders within order-driven system provides visible
liquidity.
• Offer more control over order choice.
• Order may be placed for any preferred price and size without the
need for negotiation.

53

Trading Frequency

• The determinant of when requirements are turned into
executions.
• Continuous trading – Leads to price volatility.
• Periodic Trading - Scheduled for specific time/s in the
day.
• Request-driven trading – Requesting a quote from a
market maker, but not the most efficient in terms of the
price achieved.

54

Order Types

• Order is simply an instruction to buy or sell a specific quantity
of a given asset.
• Two main types
• Market Orders – Trade immediately at the best price
available.
• Limit Orders – Have an inbuilt price limit that must not be
breached, a maximum price for buys and a minimum price
for sells.

56
